\section{Problem 1}
The cache is $256$ bytes in size, and each block is $8$ bytes each. So the number of blocks in the cache will be $256/8 = 32 $
so I need 5 buts to access the block address itself ,and each block has 8 bytes, with each memory being addressd to one byte, so we require an offset of 3 bits to keep track of the byte
being addressed. The total size of the instruction being given is 3 hexadecimals = 12 bit address. So the size of the tag will be equal to $12 - 5 - 3 = 4$ bits.
let us see the addresses in binary and check for hits and misses

\subsection{Calculating hit and miss rate of the cache}
The hit and miss rate of the cache can be calculated by taking the ratio of the hits to the total number of accesses.
 = 3/16 = 0.1875 = 18.75\%
 The miss rate = 1 - 0.1875 = 81.25\%
 \section{Problem 2}
 Here we will analyze the situation for a 2 way assosciateive cache , the split will be 5 + 4 + 3
 The number of blocks remain the same, however every 2 blocks will be free to move within one set of 2 elements
 so the number of sets = 16, all the bits are invalid at first, so they can be replaced!
\begin{verbatim}
$0x005$ : $00000 0000 101$ : Miss update on set $0000$ = 0  tag = $00000$ = 0
$0x124$ : $00010 0100 100$ : Miss update on set $0100$ = 4  tag = $00010$ = 2
$0x352$ : $00110 1010 010$ : Miss update on set $1010$ = 10  tag = $00110$ = 6
$0x224$ : $00100 0100 100$ : Miss update set filled $0100$ = 4  tag = $00100$ = 4, tag = 2
$0x126$ : $00010 0100 110$ : Hit on set $0100$ = 4  tag = $00010$ = 2
$0x350$ : $00110 1010 000$ : Hit set $1010$ = 10  tag = $00110$ = 6
$0x000$ : $00000 0000 000$ : Hit set $0000$ = 0  tag = $00000$
$0x025$ : $00000 0100 101$ : Miss update + evict on set $0100$ = 4 LRU on tag = $00100$ = 4
$0x102$ : $00010 0000 010$ : Missset filled  update on set $0000$ = 0  tag = $00010$ = 2
$0x120$ : $00010 0100 000$ : Hit on set $0100$ = 4  tag = $00010$ = 2
$0x200$ : $00100 0000 000$ : Miss update + evict LRU on set $0000$ = 0  tag = $00100$
$0x108$ : $00010 0001 000$ : Miss update on set $0001$ = 0  tag = $00010$
$0x000$ : $00000 0000 000$ : Miss update + evict on set $0000$ = 0 LRU on tag = $00010$

$0x128$ : $00010 0101 000$ : Miss update on set $0101$ = 5  tag = $00010$
$0x350$ : $00110 1010 000$ : Hit set $1010$ = 10  tag = $00110$

\subsection{Calculating hit and miss rate of the cache}
The hit and miss rate of the cache can be calculated by taking the ratio of the hits to the total number of accesses.
 = 6/16 = 0.375 = 37.5\%
 The miss rate = 1 - 0.375 = 62.5\%
This is significantly higher than that of the direct mapped cache.
